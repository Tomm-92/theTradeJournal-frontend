The Trade Journal is our final project of the CommandShift bootcamp. Checkout our presentation which explains what we built and why:

Or you can try the website for yourself and access a live version here:

https://thetradejournal.netlify.app

The dashboard page displays a news grid which can be filtered by the different news topics you're intertested in. This is powered by the Newscatcher API - https://newscatcherapi.com/

However we are using the free version and the number of calls is limited per month so you may find the page does not load correctly. I've included an image below of how it will look if the call limit has not been reached
